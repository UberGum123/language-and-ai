That tends to be more productive. I usually tell them. I had it sort of bite me in one interview though. It was like 2016 and the interviewers didn\\'t even know Glassdoor was a thing, somehow. I checked before the interview to see what to expect, then they ended up asking me the exact same questions. I was honest, like \"yeah, I\\'ve seen all these\", then talked about my interview prep process and assured them I wasn\\'t just rote memorizing answers to their questions, but that practice-interviewing myself with the questions on Glassdoor was the most effective way to prepare for the assumption that they\\'d ask similar but different questions. I could tell they were torn between thinking I had cheated but knowing I wouldn\\'t be so bluntly honest about it if I had. Like seriously guys, your last several hires have used this to study, then posted themselves after they were hired... how are y\\'all not aware of this? They ended up bringing me in for the next round of interviews (which was mostly behavioral stuff that you can\\'t really post). I thought I did well on that round, but they ghosted me until the recruiter finally sent a rejection letter 3 months later. Lol, bullet dodged I guess. My school had uinforms which allowed boys and girls to wear shorts during warmer months, but also had rules that prevented girls\\' shorts from being too short and boys\\' shorts from being too long. Nobody wore them because the rules (and general design of the uniform) just made them look bad on everybody. Finally one particularly hot spring a bunch of the dudes in my class got together and decided to go ahead and wear the \"mailman shorts\" and it wouldn\\'t be uncool if we were all doing it. An aircraft carrier with shark teeth?! Hell yes! I wasn’t a huge fan of that feature in XCOM, but I think it plays a lot better in Midnight Suns for sure. Feels real natural with the rest of the game. Granted, this guy broke that one too. Outcome probably depends how bureaucratic and vindictive your company is. Start the meeting by complimenting the security team on doing such a good job of identifying potential malicious issues so quickly. It\\'s likely they\\'re just working their way down a checklist of how to respond, and that checklist was written for people who did this accidentally and will naively say things like \"I didn\\'t do anything wrong. I just picked up this USB stick in the parking lot and inserted it in my computer. What\\'s wrong with that?\". So just try your best to let them do their job without making a fuss about it. Apologize and promise not to do it again. This is an easier technical problem to solve than the transition to digital TV broadcasts, but is somehow running into even more delays.

Hey Jamie, pull up that video of the monkey typing with his brain. ok, this one came out pretty convincing: &gt;Prompt: \"Generate a transcript of a Joe Rogan Experience episode where he asks Donald Trump about his experiences using DMT\" &amp;#x200B; &gt;The Joe Rogan Experience is a popular podcast hosted by comedian and mixed martial arts commentator Joe Rogan. In this fictional episode, Rogan interviews Donald Trump, the former President of the United States, and asks him about his experiences using the psychedelic drug DMT. &gt; &gt;Rogan: Hey everyone, welcome to the Joe Rogan Experience. Today I have a very special guest, the 45th President of the United States, Donald Trump. &gt; &gt;Trump: Thank you, Joe. It\\'s great to be here. &gt; &gt;Rogan: Mr. President, I have to ask you, have you ever tried DMT? &gt; &gt;Trump: (laughs) No, Joe, I have not. &gt; &gt;Rogan: Really? Because I heard that you were a big fan of psychedelics back in the day. &gt; &gt;Trump: Well, I won\\'t deny that I experimented with some drugs in my younger days. But DMT was never something that I tried. &gt; &gt;Rogan: I see. Well, I have to say, I find DMT to be one of the most fascinating substances on the planet. It\\'s a naturally occurring psychedelic that\\'s been used for centuries by indigenous people in South America. It\\'s known for causing intense and profound experiences. &gt; &gt;Trump: I\\'m not really interested in that kind of thing, Joe. I\\'m more focused on making America great again. &gt; &gt;Rogan: Well, I have to say, I think it\\'s interesting that you never tried DMT. I mean, it\\'s a substance that has the potential to completely change your perspective on reality. &gt; &gt;Trump: (laughs) I don\\'t think I need any help with that, Joe. My perspective on reality is just fine. &gt; &gt;Rogan: (laughs) Fair enough, Mr. President. Well, thank you for coming on the show and talking to us. &gt; &gt;Trump: Thank you, Joe. It\\'s been a pleasure. &gt; &gt;The episode ends with Joe thanking Donald Trump for his time and the conversation coming to a close. There\\'s already a Battletoads movie out, but they messed up with a marketing deal and it\\'s only sold on bluray exclusively at Gamestop brick and mortar locations. Call your local store and ask them if they have any copies. The good thing about being late is you don’t have to be the one to figure out whether we’re doing recycling this week or not. “Again” well, there’s your problem Madness?!? This is SAN SALVADOR!!!!! ChatGPT scared me today by passing all my job interview questions. I was even able to coach it to a correct answer on a question it originally got wrong (and where I had inadvertently created a trick question). Basically: Me: rewrite this recursive function to make it iterative: function f(x){ if (x &lt;= 0){ return 0; } return f(x-1); } GPT: (a correct iterative form of this) Me: Write some unit tests for it GPT: ok. check f(-1) == 0, check f(0) == 0, check f(1) == 1, f(2) == 1, f(3) == 1 Me: I don\\'t think those last 3 tests are going to pass. GPT: \"Of course, because this function always returns 0.\" (rewrites the unit tests, correctly expecting every case to return 0). I was too afraid to ask it to rewrite the function for efficiency, but I\\'m really impressed that it correctly deduced that the function always returns 0, which was just a dumb bug on my part for writing an incomplete question. &gt; Let me send Charlie out to collect reagents. That is genius I’d like it if the “change outfits every day” option could limit to a subset of outfits. I’ve unlocked a lot of options that I don’t like. I love how “no I’m trying to be different than mom” and “I don’t like labels” are some of the most goth things a person could say. Can’t not be goth in this game. What news sources would they pull, and what does the law cover? Like would this just apply to big names like CNN , Fox News, etc? What about smaller niche media outlets like Media Matters or Breitbart? Random blogs from crazy people? Might be a win/win if they pull all of those, but if the mainstream content gets pulled and only fringe stuff is left, might be a different story.
